# Network Response Input Plugin

The input plugin test UDP/TCP connections response time and can optional
verify text in the response.

## Global configuration options <!-- @/docs/includes/plugin_config.md -->

In addition to the plugin-specific configuration settings, plugins support
additional global and plugin configuration settings. These settings are used to
modify metrics, tags, and field or create aliases and configure ordering, etc.
See the [CONFIGURATION.md][CONFIGURATION.md] for more details.

[CONFIGURATION.md]: ../../../docs/CONFIGURATION.md#plugins

## Configuration

```toml @sample.conf
# Collect response time of a TCP or UDP connection
[[inputs.deepmon_port]]
  ## Protocol, must be "tcp" or "udp"
  ## NOTE: because the "udp" protocol does not respond to requests, it requires
  ## a send/expect string pair (see below).
  protocol = "tcp"
  ## Server address (default localhost)
  address = "localhost:80"

  ## Set timeout
  # timeout = "1s"

  ## Set read timeout (only used if expecting a response)
  # read_timeout = "1s"

  ## The following options are required for UDP checks. For TCP, they are
  ## optional. The plugin will send the given string to the server and then
  ## expect to receive the given 'expect' string back.
  ## string sent to the server
  # send = "ssh"
  ## expected string in answer
  # expect = "ssh"
```
